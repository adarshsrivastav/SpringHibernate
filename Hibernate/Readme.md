# Simple Hibernate Project

Basic Hibernate ORM concepts used for storing the objects into table!

Whole project is divided into Client,DAO,Modeland Template.

Client: Used to access the service to interact with database.

DAO Layer: Used to talk with database, all transaction related logic is here!

Model Layer: It represents the classes, corresponding to which tables are created in the database.

Template: Used to create session level object.

Hibernate.config.xml file  in src/main/resources: Contains all the hibernate configuration properties which helps in ORM to work properly.
